# Publishing Guide

Use this checklist before open-sourcing the Erv's TS Kitty.

## 1. Sanitize
- Remove proprietary names from prompts, guardrails, and templates
- Replace internal file paths with placeholders
- Redact metrics that reference confidential projects

## 2. Structure The Repo
- Top-level README describing goals, architecture, and quick start
- `/agents` for prompts, `/scripts` for helpers, `/docs/patterns` for knowledge base
- `/templates` for progress logs, report samples, guardrail checklists
- Add `.gitignore`, licence, and optional `package.json`

## 3. Provide Examples
- Include a sample progress log (anonymised) showing before/after metrics
- Share an example agent report to illustrate guardrail compliance
- Describe the hardware/resources used for batch sizes

## 4. Usage Recommendations
- Encourage running `node scripts/ts-error-report.mjs` or equivalent regularly
- Suggest integrating guardrail checks into CI (type-check + targeted tests)
- Document PowerShell alternatives for Windows-only teams

## 5. Promotion Ideas
- Write a blog post covering the multi-agent workflow and results
- Record a short demo of one batch in action
- Announce in TypeScript, DevOps, or AI-assisted development communities

## 6. Maintenance
- Track issues for new guardrail ideas or script improvements
- Accept contributions that add language/framework variants
- Periodically test with latest TypeScript version

Once this checklist is done, push to a public GitHub repository and tag the initial release.
